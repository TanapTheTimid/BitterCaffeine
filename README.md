Windows notification icon - double click to prevent sleep.

This is a console application that creates a notification icon in the windows taskbar. Double click the icon to toggle the function. When enabled, it disables auto sleep/screen going blank/screen saver.
If you don't like the console, just put in on another desktop that you don't use (use the windows taskview thing).

It is better to quit the software by entering "quit" in the console.
